## Overview

About the course ...

* The course is only available online. There are no PDF documents or installers for the
students - they use the same web-site we do.

* Slides use _reveal.js_ and can be viewed in a standard Web Browser. to move between
slides use the left/right arrow keys or the page up/down keys. Clicking the mouse does
not do anything.

* The course is not developed by Pivotal and we have limited control over its content.
In particular the _reveal.js_ slides are minimal in the extreme.  Fundamentally this is
an e-Learning course not intended for Instructor Led Training.

* A lot of very useful information is in the "E-Learning" popup (press 'e' in any
slide) but does not appear in the actual slides.

* When you are presenting, the Summary popup (press 's' in any slide) is useful for
reference. If you have two screens, show the slides on the projector and the popup
on your own screen.  As you move from slide to slide, they stay in sync.

This document augments the online materials for instructors. Additional PowerPoint
slides (from our original PCF Developer course) are also provided as extra source
material.


[[setup]]
## Prerequisites and Setup

Students are not required to develop in any particular language.  The applications
they need are pre-written for them.  This is really "CF _for_ Developers" not
"Developing with CF".  Make sure students are clear on this.

Students will need to have the following installed before the course, although you
can talk them through it on the first day.

* The Cloud Foundry `cf` command-line interface: https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cli#downloads
* The `curl` utility.  Curl for Windows is here: https://curl.haxx.se/download.html.
  Many Windows users find the Postman application easier: https://www.getpostman.com
  (it is available for Windows, MacOS or Linux)
* There is no `watch` utility on Windows.  However it can be simualted using a script.
   Save the following as `watch.bat`. Run using `watch <some-command>` and it will
   run that command every second:
+
```
   @ECHO OFF
   :loop
     cls
     %*
     timeout /t 1 > NUL
   goto loop
```
* A Cloud Foundry account is required.  Either students use their own CF setup or
  PWS can be used (but a couple of the labs, like the Docker lab, can't be run on PWS).
* Logging in and targeting an organization and space is not covered in the introduction
  - So you must take students through this.  The original slides from the PCF Developer
  course that went through this are in `slides/02-getting-started-cli.ppt`,
  if you wish to use them.

## The Course

The slides for this course are minimal.  Feel free to add your own slides as appropriate
to bring out important points.  Slides from the former PCF Developer are perfectly
reusable when presenting this course and are provided for you convenience in the
`slides` directory. They have been updated for PCF V2.

Most of the labs are shorter than our traditional courses.  However several ask
students questions at the end.  Go over these questions with the students at the
end of the lab.

Day 3 has fewer labs so you can afford to run behind and make it up in the last day.

[[cfd-day-1]]
### DAY 1: Basic Usage

Basic setup and usage of Cloud Foundry.

Get the class to introduce themselves, supply some background, what language do
they develop in, have they used CF (or anything similar before) and what are they
expecting to get from the course.

*Suggestion:* As they introduce themselves, write all the names down on
a sheet of paper in the same arrangement as the desks. If teaching
overseas, get one of the students to write names on the whiteboard for
you (again in desk order) so that you don’t end up stumbling over and
misspelling unfamiliar names. Write the names down afterwards, in case
some helpful person cleans the whiteboard overnight!

[cols="3,^2,9,^2",options="header"]
|=======================================================================
|  *Slides*  |  *Approx Times*  |  *Notes*  |  *Lab*

| *Course Orientation* | _9:00-9:30_ |
Sets the scene and the philosophy behind the content.  Feel free to skim or even
skip this content.  It is just an introduction.

Before or after these slides introduce yourself, then go around the room to let
the students introduce themselves.
| NONE

| *CF Motivations* | _9:30-10:00_ |
Overall background to Cloud Foundry and why you need it.  More marketing than
technical, skim or augment with your own knowledge and arguments.  The Tech Overview
has more "meat".
| NO

| *Basic Definitions* | _10:00-10:30_ |
Short section defining CF specific concepts like organizations, spaces and services.
The original concepts slides are provided if you prefer: ``slides/01-concepts.ppt``.
| NO

| *BREAK* | _10:30-11:00_ | |

| *Tech Overview* | _11:00-11:45_ |
Basic technical overview of Cloud Foundry.  In addition take students through logging
in and selecting a space.  Use these slides from the old PCF Developer course
`slides/02-getting-started-cli.ppt` if you wish.
| YES (push an app) _11:45-12:30_

| *LUNCH* | _12:30-1:30_ | | 

| *Architecture* | 45-60 minutes |
The new course does not really go into the architecture of the
PAS, but most students are keen to know what is going on "inside the box". Depending
on the group, and time available, you may wish to go through `slides/03-architecure.ppt`.
| NO

| *Core Themes* | _1:30-1:45_ |
Minimal slide deck that you can skip through quickly.
| YES (scaling) _1:45-2:05_

| *Logging & Metrics* | _2:05-2:30_ |
Minimal slide deck providing a brief overview of logging and the Loggregator
subsystem.  A whiteboard discussion of how the Loggregator works would be
useful here.  Alternatively the logging slides from the old course are in
`slides/03-logging.ppt`.
| YES (logging) _2:45-3:00_ (after break)

| *BREAK* | _2:30-2:45_ | |

| *Resilience* | _2:45-3:15_ |
Short section on the "4 levels of HA".  Again go to the whiteboard to explain more
or use `slides/05-high-availability.ppt`
| YES (kill an app) _3:15-3:30_ 

| *Services* | _3:15-3:45_ |
Minimal overview of Services and how they work.  Feel free to use the 
services slides: `slides/06-services.ppt`.
| YES (services) 3:45-4:15

|=======================================================================

If you have been using the extra slides you will probably not finish early.
The next two days are short, so it is OK to run over today.

[[cfd-day-2]]
### Day 2: Cloud Native Applications

[cols="3,^2,9,^2",options="header"]
|=======================================================================
|  Slides  |  Approx Times  |  Notes |  Lab

| *12 Factor Apps* | _9:00-9:30_ |
As the slides say these are recommendations - _not_ a 'religion'.  Many are developer
common sense, a few are due to writing for a cloud environment. The summary lists the
important ones,  For more details see `slides/07-twelve-factor.ppt`.

VI. Execute the app as one or more stateless processes - _note however that using
    persistent sessions is easier than rewriting your application to be stateless.
    For Java applications, Spring Session makes this easy using a Filter to save
    sessions to Redis, Gemfire, MongoDB or an RDBMS (Java buildpack can set this up
    automatically)_.
    
VII. Export services via port binding - _actually not necessarily so, the Java buildpack,
     for example, supports both JAR and WAR applications_.
     
IX. Maximize robustness with fast startup and graceful shutdown - _containers are
    disposable and could be shitdown at any time. Even if they don't fail, they could
    get scaled down instead_.

XI. Treat logs as event streams - _can no longer write to log files_.

The lab uses environment variables and a manifest. Neither of which are explained in the
slides.  Use `slides/08-manifests-env-vars.ppt` if you wish.
| YES 9:30-10:00 (env vars & manifest)

| *Log Drain Review* |_9:30-10:00_ |
Slides belatedly describe the Loggregator architecture but do not describe log draining,
the subject of the lab.  `slides/09-log-drain.ppt` are available.
| YES (log draining) 10:00-10:30

| *BREAK* | _10:30-11:00_ | |

| *Manipulating Routes* | _11:00-11:30_ |
Overview of routes and blue-green deployment.  Use `slides/10-blue-green.ppt` if you
prefer. There are two labs - manual blue-green deployment, then using the `cf` CLI
blue-green plugin.
| 2 LAB (blue-green, CLI plugin) _11:00-11:30_

| *App Security Groups* | _11:30-12:00_ |
Controlling outbound ("_egress_") access _from_ your application to the outside world -
in addition to any firewalls you may have.  Alternative slides are
`slides/11-app-security-grps.ppt`.

Lab involves monitoring with New Relic which is
not covered by the slides.  Use `slides/12-app-perf-mgmt.ppt`.
| LAB (monitoring) _12:00-012:30_

| *LUNCH* | _12:30-1:30_ | |

| *Staging & Running* | _1:30-2:15_ |
Buildpacks.  The original buildpack slides are in `slides/13-buildpacks.ppt`.

Lab deploys a Ruby application (Web-UI) that uses CUPS to access the Roster application as
a service - similar to the old Articulate and Attendee applications.  Lab also
asks students to push the Web-UI again, this time using the static buildpack instead.
| YES (use ruby & static buidpacks) _2:15-2:45_


| *BREAK* | _2:45-3:15_ | |

| *Microservices* | _3:30-4:15_ |
The original microservices slides are in `slides/14-microservices.ppt`.

The lab uses `cf ssh` which is not covered by any slides.
| YES (cf ssh) _3:15-3:30 _

| *Route Services* | _3:15-3:35_ |
Slides are actually reasonable, but click 'e' to show the details of what each
slide is trying to show - especially for the 2 diagrams.

Lab deploys a rate-limiting route service (same as PCF Developer course).
| YES (rate limiting) _3:35-4:00_

| *Docker* | _4:00-4:30_ |
Using Docker in PAS - this is not PKS.
| 2 Labs (XP - deploy and use Docker app) _4:30-5:00_

|=======================================================================


[[day-3]]
### Day 3: Advanced Features

This day covers many interesting topics that we never had time to include in
the PCF Developer course but the slides will not help you much.  Consider
presenting from the slides popup (hit 's' in any slide) due to the extra depth
of information.

[cols="3,^2,9,^2",options="header"]
|=======================================================================
|  Slides  |  Approx Times  |  Notes |  Lab

| *TCP Routing* | _9:00-9:30_ |
Supporting protocols other than HTTP. Most commonly used to send HTTPS directly
to your application or by IoT devices using various protocols.
| No

| *UAA & OAuth2* | _9:30-10:00_ |
A good grasp of OAuth2 is required here and the slides don't really go into depth.
If you have OAuth2 slides, use them. 

The lab notes state: _A compiled version of the
UAA, and a corresponding deployment manifest have been made available_.  This sentence
contains two links - one to the UAA app and one to its manifest - not obvious.

Lab first deploys the UAA application and then sets up a route service to use it.
A great example, but challenging.
| 2 Labs (using UAA) _10:00-11:30_ (incl break)

| *BREAK* | _10:30-11:00_ | |

| *Cloud Native* | 11:00-11:20|
Very high-level.  Lots of motherhood statements but not much practical guidance.
Augment with any additional material you may have.
| NONE

| *Cascading Failures* | _11:20-11:40_ |
Discusses high availability in a microservices environment and a brief overview of
the circuit breaker pattern.  The Web-UI application has circuit-breaker functionality
built-in and is used in the lab.
| YES (circuit breaker demo) _11:40-12:00_

| *Distributed Tracing* |_12:00-12:30_ |
Minimal overview.
| NONE

| *LUNCH* | _12:30-1:30_ | | 

| *App Lifecycle* | _1:30-2:00_ |
Deploying applications to multiple spaces to reflect the application lifecycle - dev
to testing to QA to UAT ... to production.  The slides show all this happening in a
single CF Foundation (installation).  In practice we recommend making production a
separate foundation for obvious security reasons.

Lab shows using multiple domains so an extra domain must have been setup in advance.
Lab will not work on PWS.
| YES (XP - multiple domains) _2:00-2:30_

| *BREAK* | _2:30-3:00_ | |

| *Non-Breaking Contracts* | _3:00-3:30_ |
Microservices rely on the interface between different processes remaining constant -
the protocol and data-representation must stay the same.  Doing this is hard and this
section offers some guidance.
| NO

| *CI/CD Automation* | _3:30-4:00_ |
Building automated deployment pipelines.  Important topic but few slides.
| NO

| *Completed* | _4:00-4:30_|
The online course has no end of course slides - so use `slides/15-completed.ppt`.
The course is preparation for the CF Foundation's certification process.
Don't forget your evaluation.
| NO |
